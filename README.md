# Mars created by Daniel Frost
This project is meant to be a "Google Street View" like tour of a few places on Mars. Users can stop around at different points and pan around the area,
viewing a panorama stitched together by Mars' Curiosity rover. The project features interactive arrows to cycle through stations in chronological order,
as well as an expandable minimap that allows users to quickly jump between stations.
